---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Implementation**

### **Complete Game End Flow:**
1. **Trigger Event** (score limit, forfeit, disconnection, time limit)
2. **Validation** (player authorization, game state checks)  
3. **Result Calculation** (winner determination, final scores)
4. **Broadcasting** (game_ended, winner_celebration, detailed_results)
5. **Database Persistence** (game results, player statistics)
6. **Cleanup Scheduling** (resource management, room cleanup)

### **Event Broadcasting System:**
```javascript
// Multiple broadcast phases implemented:
1. game_ended (immediate)
2. winner_celebration (500ms delay) 
3. detailed_results (after celebration)
4. game_cleanup_starting (before cleanup)
```

### **Database Integration:**
```javascript
// Comprehensive persistence:
- Game results with metadata
- Player statistics updates
- Retry logic (3 attempts)
- Error handling and logging
```
